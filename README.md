# Explore-exploit trade-off in vocal learning
## Abstract

In studying vocal learning in humans, songbirds, and marmosets, we investigated whether exploration plays a crucial role in the early stages of vocal development. Despite differences in learning mechanisms among the species, they all exhibit high variability in initial vocalizations compared to later ones. Using a reinforcement learning model, we found that starting the learning process with exploration leads to more accurate and robust learning of new vocalizations compared to scenarios where only imitation is present. This suggests that exploration facilitates vocal learning by allowing for the robust acquisition of diverse vocalizations. Additionally, exploration helps address the "poverty of stimulus" issue, as vocal learners create acoustic richness through self-exploration rather than relying solely on external stimuli.
